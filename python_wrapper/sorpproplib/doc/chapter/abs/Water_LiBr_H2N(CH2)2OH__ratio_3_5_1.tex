Pressure $p$ in $\si{\pascal}$ is calculated depending on concentration $X$ in $\si{\kilogram\per\kilogram}$ and  temperature $T$ in $\si{\kelvin}$ by:
%
\begin{equation*}
\nicefrac{p}{d} = 10 ^ { \sum_{i=0}^{4} \left( A_i + \frac{1000 B_i}{T - c} \right) \left( 100 X \right) ^{i}}

To generate the figure, the following refrigerant functions were selected:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vapor pressure: VaporPressure\_EoS1 - ID 1
\item Saturated liquid density: SaturatedLiquidDensity\_EoS1 - ID 1
\end{itemize}

The uncertainity of the experimental data is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data source $\,\to\,$ Data was taken from table
\item Temperature, relative, in \% $\,\to\,$ 0.4
\end{itemize}

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the experimental and calculated data results in 14.58\%.
