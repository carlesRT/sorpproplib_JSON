\textbf{Equation and parameters:}

%
Pressure $p$ in $\si{\pascal}$ is calculated depending on molar fraction of refrigerant in the liquid phase $x_1$ in $\si{\mole\per\mole}$, temperature $T$ in $\si{\kelvin}$, molar volumes of both components ($v_1$ and $v_2$) in $\si{\cubic\meter\per\mole}$, and vapor pressure $p_\mathrm{sat,1}$ in $\si{\pascal}$. If molar volumes less than zero are used as function arguements, constant molar volumes given by parameter record are used. Equilibrium equation is given by:
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
p &=& \gamma_1 x_1 p_\mathrm{sat,1} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\gamma_1 &=& \exp \left( \ln \left( 1 - \left( 1 - \nicefrac{1}{r} \right) \Phi_2  \right) + \left(1 - \nicefrac{1}{r}\right) \Phi_2 + \Gamma \Phi_2 ^2 \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
\Phi_2 &=& r \frac{x_2}{x_1 + r x_2} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\Gamma &=& \nicefrac{w_0^{*}}{T} \left( 1 + \nicefrac{w_1}{T} \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
x_2 &=& 1 - x_1  & \quad\text{.} \\

\textbf{Validity:}

Equation is approximately valid for $303.15 \si{\kelvin} \leq T \leq 363.15 \si{\kelvin}$.

To generate the figure, the following refrigerant functions were selected:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vapor pressure: VaporPressure\_EoS1 - ID 1
\item Saturated liquid density: SaturatedLiquidDensity\_EoS1 - ID 1
\end{itemize}

The uncertainity of the experimental data is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data source $\,\to\,$ Data was taken from table
\end{itemize}

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the experimental and calculated data results in 33.34\%.
