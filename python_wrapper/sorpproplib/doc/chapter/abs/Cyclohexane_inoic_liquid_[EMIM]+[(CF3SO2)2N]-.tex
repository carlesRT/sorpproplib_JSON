Pressure $p$ in $\si{\pascal}$ is calculated depending on molar fraction of refrigerant in the liquid phase $x_1$ in $\si{\mole\per\mole}$, temperature $T$ in $\si{\kelvin}$, and vapor pressure $p_\mathrm{sat,1}$ in $\si{\pascal}$ by:
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
p &=& \gamma_1 x_1 p_\mathrm{sat,1} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\gamma_1 &=& \exp \left( x_2^2 \left( \tau_{21} \left( \frac{G_{21}}{x_1 + x_2 G_{21}} \right) ^2 + \tau_{12} \frac{G_{12}}{\left( x_2 + x_1 G_{12} \right) ^2}\right) \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
G_{12} &=& \exp \left( -\alpha_{12} \tau_{12} \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
G_{21} &=& \exp \left( -\alpha_{21} \tau_{21} \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
\tau_{12} &=& \nicefrac{\Delta g_{12}}{R T} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\tau_{21} &=& \nicefrac{\Delta g_{21}}{R T} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\Delta g_{12} &=& a_{12} + b_{12} T & \quad\text{, and} \\
\Delta g_{21} &=& a_{21} + b_{21} T & \quad\text{, and} \\
x_2 &=& 1 - x_1  & \quad\text{.} \\

To generate the figure, the following refrigerant functions were selected:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vapor pressure: VaporPressure\_EoS1 - ID 1
\item Saturated liquid density: SaturatedLiquidDensity\_EoS1 - ID 1
\end{itemize}

The uncertainity of the experimental data is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data source $\,\to\,$ Data was taken from table
\end{itemize}

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the experimental and calculated data results in 26.56\%.
