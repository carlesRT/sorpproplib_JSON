Pressure $p$ in $\si{\pascal}$ is calculated depending on molar fraction of refrigerant in the liquid phase $x_1$ in $\si{\mole\per\mole}$, temperature $T$ in $\si{\kelvin}$, and vapor pressure $p_\mathrm{sat,1}$ in $\si{\pascal}$ by:
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
p &=& \gamma_1 x_1 p_\mathrm{sat,1} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\gamma_1 &=& \exp \left( x_2^2 \left( \tau_{21} \left( \frac{G_{21}}{x_1 + x_2 G_{21}} \right) ^2 + \tau_{12} \frac{G_{12}}{\left( x_2 + x_1 G_{12} \right) ^2}\right) \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
G_{12} &=& \exp \left( -\alpha_{12} \tau_{12} \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
G_{21} &=& \exp \left( -\alpha_{21} \tau_{21} \right) & \quad\text{, and} \\
\tau_{12} &=& \nicefrac{\Delta g_{12}}{R T} & \quad\text{, and} \\
\tau_{21} &=& \nicefrac{\Delta g_{21}}{R T} & \quad\text{, and} \\
x_2 &=& 1 - x_1  & \quad\text{.} \\
