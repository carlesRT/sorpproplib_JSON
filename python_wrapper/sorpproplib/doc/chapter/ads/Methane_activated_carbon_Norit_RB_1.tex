Loading $w$ in $\si{\kilogram\per\kilogram}$ is calculated depending on pressure $p$ in $\si{\pascal}$ and temperature $T$ in $\si{\kelvin}$ by:
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
w &=& \frac{w_\mathrm{sat} K p}{1 + K p} & \quad\text{, and} \\
K &=& K_0 \exp \left( \frac{\Delta H}{R T} \right) & \quad\text{.}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Validity:}
\newline
Equation is approximately valid for $44955.8 \si{\pascal} \leq p \leq 700365.0 \si{\pascal}$,  $294.5 \si{\kelvin} \leq T \leq 348.3 \si{\kelvin}$, and $0.00334641 \si{\kilogram\per\kilogram} \leq w \leq 0.057098 \si{\kilogram\per\kilogram}$.

To generate the figure, the following refrigerant functions were selected:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vapor pressure: VaporPressure\_EoS1 - ID 1
\item Saturated liquid density: SaturatedLiquidDensity\_EoS1 - ID 1
\end{itemize}

The uncertainity of the experimental data is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data source $\,\to\,$ Data was taken from table
\end{itemize}

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the experimental and calculated data results in 2.68\%.
